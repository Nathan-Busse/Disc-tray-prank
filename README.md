# Disc-tray-prank
A batch file that constantly opens the disk tray even if you close it.

# How to use

Clone the Repository and extract the file.
Then just double click on the batch file and click ok to allow windows to run the file.

# Note

I have only tested the script on windows machines with built in disk drives.

Enjoy.
